## Exploring XOR Classification with MLP, Regularization, and Feature Engineering

### **Description:**  
This repository explores the XOR classification problem using various machine learning approaches, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with and without regularization, and Logistic Regression with engineered features. Key highlights:  
- **MLP**: Baseline model for XOR classification.  
- **MLP with L1 Regularization**: Sparsity-inducing regularization to evaluate feature selection's impact on decision boundaries.  
- **MLP with L2 Regularization**: Smoothness-inducing regularization to reduce overfitting and analyze its effect on the XOR problem.  
- **Logistic Regression with Feature Engineering**: Incorporates non-linear features like \(x_1 \cdot x_2\) and \(x_1^2\) to capture the non-linear nature of the XOR function.  

The repository includes decision surface visualizations for each model, along with a comparative analysis of their ability to capture the XOR decision boundary.
